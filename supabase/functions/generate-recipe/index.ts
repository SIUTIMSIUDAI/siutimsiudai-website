// Supabase Edge Function: generate-recipe
//
// Server-side proxy for Google Cloud Vertex AI (Gemini). The billable credential lives HERE as a
// Supabase secret (GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY) and never ships to a device or the app bundle. The
// client (services/recipeGenerationService.ts) sends { ingredients: [{name,nameZh,quantity?,unit?}] };
// we ask Gemini for ONE simple recipe that uses only a sensible subset of those ingredients (plus
// basic staples) and return it as a StructuredRecipe-shaped JSON object.
//
// Deploy:  supabase functions deploy generate-recipe
// Secrets: shared with pantry-scan — see that function's header (GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY, and
//          optional GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT / VERTEX_LOCATION / VERTEX_MODEL). Auth flow + token
//          minting live in ../_shared/vertex.ts. The service account needs the "Vertex AI User" role.
//
// Product constraint enforced here: the prompt NEVER receives the user's nutrition targets and is
// explicitly told not to optimise for them. This is a generic "use up what you have" recipe, by
// design — nutrition tailoring belongs to the logging flow, not the pantry.
//
// Runs in the Supabase Deno runtime, excluded from the app tsconfig. `Deno` is a runtime global.
